# Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure having following properties:
- left subtree contains value lesser than root nodes value
- right subtree contains value greater than root nodes value
- left and right subtree each must also be a BST

## Time Complexity of Different BST Operations
